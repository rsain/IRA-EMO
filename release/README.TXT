- YOU CAN FOLLOW THE NEXT STEPS IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS -
------------------------------------------------------

1) If you have not installed GNUPlot, you have to install it. You can download it here (http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/files/gnuplot/4.6.3/).

2) You have to edit the configuration file "data/IRA.config" and type the location of the GNUPlot.exe file (the default location 'c:\gnuplot\bin\gnuplot.exe' is set). If your GNUPlot installation is in the default folder, you can ignore this step.

3) It is a JAVA application. For this the reason you need, at least, the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 7. You can get it here (https://www.java.com/es/download/).

4) To run tha application, you have to double click over the "IRA.jar" file. It can take until 1 minute the first time (be patient!). If nothing happen, possibly your java installation is not in the PATH. In that case, contact with me.
